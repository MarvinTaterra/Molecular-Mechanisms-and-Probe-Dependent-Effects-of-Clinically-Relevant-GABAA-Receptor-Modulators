Deep learning-enhanced sampling of GABAA receptor activation using DeepTDA collective variables and OPES metadynamics (GROMACS + PLUMED).

This repository contains the code and inputs for deep learning-based enhanced sampling of GABAA receptor state transitions, as described in Taterra et al. (2026). A Deep Targeted Discriminant Analysis (DeepTDA) neural network was trained to distinguish resting, open, and desensitized receptor conformations using ANOVA-selected Cα–Cα distances (~10,000 features from 1.4M descriptors). The learned collective variable was used to bias OPES simulations (10 walkers, ~24 ns) in GROMACS 2024.3 patched with PLUMED v2.9. Systems investigated include the GABA-bound, GABA+diazepam, and GABA+phenobarbital receptor. Feature importance was assessed using integrated gradients. Free energy profiles were obtained by reweighting biased trajectories following Invernizzi & Parrinello (2020). Built with mlcolvar, Optuna, and MDAnalysis.
